# assignment_dynamic_url_shortener
Build a URL shortening service, outfitted with realtime analytics.

Synopsis
-----
I built a URL shortener program similar to [goo.gl](https://goo.gl/)

Usage
-----
From command-line: 
```
node index.js
```

From browser: 
```
localhost:3000
```

Highlights: 
-----
- full-stack development
- used Redis in-memory data structure store
- and Socket.io for persistant connection between browser and server (baby steps)
- Express handled my routes
- with Handlebars for templating
- and lots of promises for handling async calls
